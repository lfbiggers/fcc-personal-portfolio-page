      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Trying to become a next level coding ninja, but feeling a lot more like a frustrated monkey most of the time.</p>
      <p>I'm 24. I've been married for 6 years, and we have 2 handsome little sons and a brand new baby girl. I have an A.S. in Psychology that I recieved when I was 18. That's as far as my formal education has gone. I reset my FreeCodeCamp account in October of 2018, and have since dedicated myself to the task of earning all 6 certifications, as well as the final full stack certificate. I want to be able to say that I taught myself to code, and I know that if I can do it, so can you.</p>
